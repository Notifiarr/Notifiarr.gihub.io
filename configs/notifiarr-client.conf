# This API key must be copied from your notifiarr.com account.
api_key = ""

## The ip:port or port to listen on for incoming web requests.
## You can use 127.0.0.1:5454 to listen only on localhost.
## This will be used in Plex for example to send webhooks, Example: http://localhost:5454
## This will be used in Media Requests for example to send payloads, Example: http://your-domain.com:5454
##
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:5454"

## Quiet makes the app not log anything to output.
## Recommend setting log files if you make the app quiet.
## This is always true on Windows and macOS app.
## Log files are automatically written on those platforms.
##
quiet = false

## All API paths start with /api. This does not affect incoming /plex webhooks.
## Change it to /somethingelse/api by setting urlbase to "/somethingelse"
##
urlbase = "/"

## Allowed upstream networks. The networks here are allowed to send x-forwarded-for.
## Set this to your reverse proxy server's IP or network. If you leave off the mask,
## then /32 or /128 is assumed depending on IP version. Empty by default. Example:
##
#upstreams = [ "127.0.0.1/32", "::1/128" ]

## If you provide a cert and key file (pem) paths, this app will listen with SSL/TLS.
## Uncomment both lines and add valid file paths. Make sure this app can read them.
##
#ssl_key_file  = '/path/to/cert.key'
#ssl_cert_file = '/path/to/cert.key'

## If you set these, logs will be written to these files.
## If blank on windows or macOS, log file paths are chosen for you.
log_file = "/var/log/notifiarr/app.log"
http_log = "/var/log/notifiarr/http.log"
##
## Set this to the number of megabytes to rotate files.
log_file_mb = 100
##
## How many files to keep? 0 = all.
log_files = 10

## Web server and application timeouts.
##
timeout = "1m0s"

## The API keys are specific to the app. Get it from Settings -> General.
## Configurations for unused apps are harmless. Set URL and API key for
## apps you have and want to make requests to using Media Bot.
## See the Service Checks section below for information about setting the names.
##
## Examples follow. UNCOMMENT (REMOVE #), AT MINIMUM: [[header]], url, api_key

#[[radarr]]
#name    = "" # set a name to enable checks of your service.

# Service Checks #
##################

## This application performs service checks on configured services at the specified interval.
## The service states are sent to Notifiarr.com. Failed services generate a notification.
## Setting names on Starr apps (above) enables service checks for that app.
## Use the [[service]] directive to add more service checks. Example below.

[services]
  disabled = false   # Setting this to true disables all service checking routines.
  parallel = 1       # How many services to check concurrently. 1 should be enough.
  interval = "10m0s" # How often to send service states to Notifiarr.com. Minimum = 5m.

## Uncomment the following section to create a service check on a URL or IP:port.
## You may include as many [[service]] sections as you have services to check.
## Do not add Radarr, Sonarr, Readarr or Lidarr here! Add a name to enable their checks.
##
## Example with comments follows.
#[[service]]
#  name     = "MyServer"          # name must be unique
#  type     = "http"              # type can be "http" or "tcp"
#  check    = 'http://127.0.0.1'  # url for 'http', host/IP:port for 'tcp'
#  expect   = "200"               # return code to expect (for http only)
#  timeout  = "10s"               # how long to wait for tcp or http checks.
#  interval = "5m"                # how often to check this service.

## Another example. Remember to uncomment [[service]] if you use this!
##
#[[service]]
#  name    = "Bazarr"
#  type    = "http"
#  check   = 'http://10.1.1.2:6767/series/'
#  expect  = "200"
#  timeout = "10s"
